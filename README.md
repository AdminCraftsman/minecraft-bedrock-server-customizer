A series of PowerShell Scripts to build and customize minecraft bedrock servers for my kids

My kids love playing Minecraft and are always excited to try out new worlds, resource packs, and mods they see in online videos. Keeping up with their requests meant constantly downloading the latest Minecraft Bedrock Server releases and manually setting up new server instances—a time-consuming process. To simplify things, I wrote these PowerShell scripts to automate server setup and customization, and I'm sharing them here in case others find them useful.

Why PowerShell instead of Python? Personally, I find PowerShell's syntax and structure more straightforward and less "gimmicky" than Python—maybe that's just my preference from years of working with Windows environments.

Would these servers run better on Linux? Absolutely! My long-term goal is to migrate everything to Linux-based Docker containers for efficiency and scalability. For now, though, I'm running the scripts on a Windows VM out of convenience.
